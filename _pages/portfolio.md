## Video: The Censored Radiohead Song
[![Video thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/gQxfdacPpgo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQxfdacPpgo "Watch the video")

A short video I researched, wrote, and edited about the history and context surrounding Radiohead's song "Pop Is Dead", which ultimately garnered over 200k views. I was inspired to create it when I discovered the song through an unofficial Vimeo upload and realized I had never heard of it because the band had actively removed it from any official online record. In the video, I delve into how the song came about and why Radiohead might have decided that they didn't want it online.

## 31-EDO Digital Keyboard

I created this web synth to play with melodies and harmonies beyond the 12 notes of the Western scale. Specifically, the user can play notes tuned in 31-EDO (equal divisions of the octave) using their computer keyboard, allowing them to access 31 different notes instead of just 12. The user can also switch back to standard 12-EDO if they wish. Furthermore, this webpage functions as a simple synthesizer, with several options to customize the sound produced.
This is a spinoff of a project for my Computational Sound course.

Works best in Chrome.

A short story I originally wrote for a creative writing group at Oxford. I aim to explore themes of memory, legacy, and ambition through a portrayal of life in the Midwest.

## Music: Instrumentals
{% include music.html %}

These are instrumentals from songs I wrote and produced with the vocal tracks removed, so that the listener can better focus on their musical composition and structure.

## Essay: The Better Symphony 

[Read the paper here](https://williamyzhang.github.io/portfolio/files/the-better-symphony-beethoven-paper.pdf)

A short paper I researched and wrote about Beethoven's 8th Symphony. This paper was written for Prof. Sisman's class on Beethoven, which was one of my favorite classes I took at Columbia. I drew on the past century of work in musicology to come to a better understanding of one of Beethoven's more mysterious and less popular symphonies, the 8th.
