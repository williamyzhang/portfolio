        <p>A short video I researched, wrote, and edited about the history and context surrounding Radiohead's song "Pop Is Dead", which ultimately garnered over 200k views. I was inspired to create it when I discovered the song through an unofficial Vimeo upload and realized I had never heard of it because the band had actively removed it from any official online record. In the video, I delve into how the song came about and why Radiohead might have decided that they didn't want it online.</p>
        
        <!-- <h2> 31-EDO Digital Keyboard </h2>

        I created this web synth to play with melodies and harmonies beyond the 12 notes of the Western scale. Specifically, the user can play notes tuned in 31-EDO (equal divisions of the octave) using their computer keyboard, allowing them to access 31 different notes instead of just 12. The user can also switch back to standard 12-EDO if they wish. Furthermore, this webpage functions as a simple synthesizer, with several options to customize the sound produced.
        This is a spinoff of a project for my Computational Sound course.
        
        Works best in Chrome.
