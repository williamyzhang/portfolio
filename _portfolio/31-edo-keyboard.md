A spinoff of a project for my Computational Sound course, I created this keyboard to have an easily accessible way to explore microtonal harmonies. 
The keyboard allows users to switch between 12 and 31 equal temperament, as well as design their own timbre with different modes of synthesis.

Works best in Chrome.
