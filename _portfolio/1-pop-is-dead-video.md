This is a short video I researched, wrote, and edited about the history and context surrounding Radiohead's song "Pop Is Dead." I was inspired to create it when I discovered the song through an unofficial Vimeo upload and realized I had never heard of it before because the band had actively removed it from any official online record. In the video, I delved into how the song came about and why Radiohead might have eventually decided that they didn't want it online.
